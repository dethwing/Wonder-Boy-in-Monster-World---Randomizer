# Simple Randomizer Maker
This is a program that allows you to easily create your own game randomizer with little to no coding.

## How It Works
[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBnwh5lcSBc)

All you need are the file addresses of whatever you want to change, along with possible values for those addresses, and the maker will do everything else for you, from the actual randomization to the GUI. You can make address values completely random, or you can set rules that they must follow (like if you want certain values to change according to other values).

## Features
- Create a randomizer with (basically) no coding
- Add optional rulesets to make your randomizer more complex (while keeping it easy to develop)
- Utilizes backtracking constraint satisfaction and attribute/rule optimization for fast generation
- Dynamic GUI that changes according to settings and number of options
- Built-in seed support with verification to check for invalid seeds
- Generates up to 20 unique seeds at once
- Supports multi-byte addresses
- Supports games that use multiple files
- Supports CRC32 hash verification
- Optionally generates a text log of all randomized values
- Includes detailed tutorial plus two sample randomizers

## Example Functions
I recommend you look at the [included tutorial](https://github.com/GateGuy/SimpleRandomizerMaker/blob/master/Readme%20(Tutorial).md) and templates, but the short version is that this program works through three types of objects: Attributes (the things you want to randomize), Rules (requirements that the randomized values must follow), and Rulesets (sets of Rules that are grouped together). Here are some examples:
```
Attribute(
	name="My Attribute",
	addresses=[0x456, 0xABC],
	number_of_bytes=1,
	possible_values=[1,4,21,83,106],
	min_value=None,
	max_value=None,
),
```
```
Rule(
	description="My Attribute 2 + My Attribute 3 is at least 20",
	left_side=value("My Attribute 2") + value("My Attribute 3"),
	rule_type=">=",
	right_side=20,
),
```
```
Rule(
	description="My Attribute 1 must be one of these values",
	left_side=value("My Attribute 1"),
	rule_type="==",
	right_side=[1, 4, 6, 13, 18],
),
```
```
Rule(
	description="These three attributes have to be different",
	left_side=[value("My Attribute 1"), value("My Attribute 2"), value("My Attribute 3")],
	rule_type="!=",
	right_side=None,
),
```
```
Rule(
	description="My Attribute 1 is 5, or My Attribute 2 is less than 10 (or both)",
	left_side=[(value("My Attribute 1"), "==", 5), (value("My Attribute 2"), "<", 10)],
	rule_type="count",
	right_side=("==", True, ">=", 1),
),
```
